**** POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO BELLMAN-FORD ****

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm#Improvements

1. [DONE] Early termination condition: If the main loop of the algorithm 
terminates without making changes, the algorithm can be terminated immediately 
because no more changes will be made. Helps in average, but not worst, 
case (Wikipedia)

2. Yen's first improvement: early termination. If any vertex v has a distance
value that has not change since the last time the edges out of v were relaxed, 
that edge does not need to be relaxed anymore. Helps in average, but not worst, 
case for dense graphs (Wikipedia)

3. Yen's second improvement

4. Bannister & Eppstein

5. SPFA (Chinese algorithm, adds FIFO to Bellman ford)
